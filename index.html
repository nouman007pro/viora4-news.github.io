            <h2>Trudeau hits out at 'dumb' tariffs as Trump warns of further hikes against Canada</h2>
            <p>Trade War Alert:

                Trump added 25% taxes on Canadian/Mexican goods & increased China tariffs
                
                Canada strikes back with retaliatory tariffs on US products
                
                Mexico joins fight, promises countermeasures
                
                Trudeau's Strong Reaction:
                
                Calls Trump's move "dumb economic policy"
                
                Vows "relentless fight to protect Canadian jobs"
                
                Warns: "No winners in US-Canada trade war"
                
                Denies Trump's claim about Canada causing fentanyl crisis (less than 1% comes from Canada)
                
                Trump's Defense:
                
                Claims tariffs protect US manufacturing jobs
                
                Links policy to stopping illegal immigration & drug trafficking
                
                Threatens "reciprocal tariff increases" if Canada retaliates
                
                Economic Warning:
                
                Experts predict price increases on:
                
                Food (fruits/vegetables from Mexico)
                
                Oil/gas (Canadian imports)

                Why This Matters:
                
                Canada/Mexico are top US trading partners
                
                $1.5 trillion in annual trade at risk
                
                Could impact consumer prices & job markets worldwide

            <h2>"How Saudi Arabia helps Ukraine"</h2>
            <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the United States has "just about" ended its suspension of intelligence sharing with Ukraine. This development comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy travels to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for critical discussions with U.S. officials aimed at resolving the ongoing conflict with Russia.

                The suspension of intelligence sharing and military aid was initially implemented to pressure Ukraine into engaging in peace talks with Russia. The upcoming talks in Riyadh will assess Ukraine's willingness to make concessions to end the war, with discussions also focusing on a potential minerals agreement between Washington and Kyiv. 
                REUTERS
                
                President Trump expressed optimism about the forthcoming negotiations, stating, "We're going to make a lot of progress, I believe, this week." He also indicated that he believes Ukraine will sign the minerals agreement but emphasized the need for Ukraine to demonstrate a stronger commitment to peace. 
                THE JERUSALEM POST
                
                In Riyadh, President Zelenskyy is scheduled to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman before the talks with U.S. officials. Zelenskyy has reiterated Ukraine's dedication to seeking peace and is preparing realistic proposals for negotiation. 
                REUTERS
                
                The international community is closely monitoring these developments, as the outcomes of the Riyadh talks could significantly impact the trajectory of the conflict in Ukraine.
